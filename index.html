    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a forest scene in which 
	details of each tree (e.g. position, trunk color and size, crown color and shape) 
	are stored in parallel 2D arrays. Trees are arranged in a regular grid but their 
	positions are jittered by  small random offsets to create the impression of a real 
	forest. Similarly, each tree trunk and crown has a individual color shade, obtained
	using  random variations of brown and green. Finally, the forest changes over time:
	trees grow and their crowns become more pale to suggest seasonal change ( from 
        spring to autumn).
