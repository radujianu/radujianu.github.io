      <h3>Radu Jianu</h3>
      <p>In 2016 I became part of the <a href="https://www.gicentre.net/">giCentre</a> at City, University of London where I teach and conduct research 
       in information visualization, visual analytics, and human computer interaction. </p>
       I received a Ph.D in Computer Science, with a focus on data visualization, from Brown University in 2012. 
       Between my PhD and my move to London I was an Assistant Professor at Florida International University.

       
     <p>I am currently exploring novel ways in which the increasingly affordable eye-tracking technology can change how people 
     use visual data analysis systems. Specifically, I explore both diagnostic uses of eye-tracking (e.g., understanding how analysts 
     explore information and aggregate knowledge), and interactive uses of eye-tracking (e.g., highlighting visualization elements users focus on). 
    In a separate project, I look at how evaluating visualizations via user studies can be automated using crowd-sourcing and benchmark tasks. 
    Finally, I search for practical applications of such fundamental computer science research through interdisciplinary collaborations with 
    researchers in areas such as proteomics, genomics, neuroscience, economics, or architecture. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a forest scene in which 
	details of each tree (e.g. position, trunk color and size, crown color and shape) 
	are stored in parallel 2D arrays. Trees are arranged in a regular grid but their 
	positions are jittered by  small random offsets to create the impression of a real 
	forest. Similarly, each tree trunk and crown has a individual color shade, obtained
	using  random variations of brown and green. Finally, the forest changes over time:
	trees grow and their crowns become more pale to suggest seasonal change ( from 
        spring to autumn).

    <h3>Java project: 2D Game, Student in University</h3>
    <p>
	My Java project involved students, universities, and assignments. It was a great
        opportunity to learn about object oriented programming, model view programming,
        interaction and GUIs, files, etc.
