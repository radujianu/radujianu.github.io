Science contrarianism: Populist rhetoric eroded trust in science/policy and spurred resistance to mitigation (Soc Sci Med, 2024).\n4. Compliance/Awareness: Populist beliefs (distrust of authority) predict lower compliance with COVID rules (Uluşahin et al., 2024).\n5. Power consolidation: Populist governments exploited pandemic to consolidate power and circumvent oversight.\n6. Right-wing populism: Linked to greater resistance to vaccination/mitigation (2022 paper).\n7.

Historical events like the Mineriads (1990s): Major events may be under-registered in indices due to lower documentation and less observer presence.\n3. V-Dem methodology shifts: More/changed indicators, coder rotation, evolving question framing cause measurement noise—especially for early years.\n4.
