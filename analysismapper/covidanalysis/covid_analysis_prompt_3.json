Resulted in public distrust in science and discourse polarization.\n2. \"Medical Populism and COVID19 Testing\" (Hedges & Lasco, 2021): Populist communication on COVID testing—simplified info, spectacle, divisive narratives, claims to unique knowledge—shaped public perception and compliance.\n3. Social Science & Medicine (2024): Populist rhetoric during health crises erodes trust in science and public health, strengthens resistance to mitigation.\n4. Uluşahin et al (2024): Survey—Populist beliefs and distrust of authority correlate with non-compliance, reinforcing anti-elitism.\n5. Policy analyses (e.g. \"Perilous Mix of Populism and Pandemics\"): Populist governments ignored experts, overstated success, used pandemic for power consolidation.\n6. \"RightWing Populism... Resistance to COVID19 Measures\" (2022): Right-wing populist support correlates with resistance to vaccination and policies due to identity/political trust dynamics.\n7. Case study reports: Philippines, Brazil, US—Lockdowns and rhetoric justified authoritarian measures, blame-shifting, underpinning science/institution undermining.\n\nKey mechanisms:\n- Politicizing science as elite threat\n- Simplification/spectacle narrratives\n- Distrust/non-compliance cued by populist discourse\n- Power consolidation—using emergency measures to sidestep checks\n- Polarized social identity construction\n\nReferences include: Lasco & Persson (2022), Gerbaudo (2021), academic/policy reports, news summaries.\nLinks provided in the full response.",

Special 'Pandemic Backsliding' sub-project for COVID-specific democracy tracking (2020–21).\n\nUse: Analyze year-by-year shifts in democracy, polarization, populist discourse, and executive constraints before, during, and after the pandemic (2018–24). For higher frequency, panel (month) data is available for v14 and up (extra care required). Link with COVID-19 policy stringency datasets for impact analysis.\n\nData Content Summary (from codebook):\n1. High-Level Indices: Electoral Democracy (v2x_polyarchy), Liberal Democracy (v2x_liberal), Deliberative Democracy (v2x_delibdem), Participatory Democracy (v2x_partipdem), Egalitarian Democracy (v2x_egal)\n2. Mid-Level/Sub-Indices (~92 vars): judicial independence, civil society robustness, legislative constraints, media freedom, political equality, minority exclusion, executive oversight\n3. Low-Level Indicators (~167 vars): elections, political parties, direct democracy, executive concentration/manipulation, legislature power, judiciary, civil liberties, sovereignty/state efficiency, civil society, media, political equality, exclusion/vulnerable groups, academic/civic space, COVID-19 restrictions/rights limitation\n4. COVID-19 Special Section: government pandemic-related restrictions/exceptional measures (Section 3.16, codebook); supports study of pandemic effects on democracy/populism\n5. Metadata: country name, ISO, region, year; Type E variables from external sources\n6. Populist Discourse: v2pepopul for executive-level populist rhetoric\n\nFlexible selection of summary indices or granular variables for comparative work. Panel structure permits merging with policy or outcome data from OxCGRT, ESS, etc.",
