Key for quantifying policy response/severity, including subnational level (e.g., US states).\n - File format: CSV (daily updates). Direct download (GitHub/official sources).\n - Key variables: StringencyIndex, GovernmentResponseIndex, ContainmentHealthIndex, EconomicSupportIndex, policy flags, country, date, ISO codes.\n - Use: Quantify severity/duration of policies by country, lag policy indices to test predictions for populist outcomes or unrest.\n\n2. The PopuList (Populist Parties in Europe, v3.0)\n - Expert-coded dataset of European political parties by ideology (populist/far-right/left), with vote shares and parliamentary representation across elections. Captures party/classification detail, start/end periods, borderline/ruling status, country, and ideology markers.\n - File format: TSV/CSV. Direct download typically via OSF/official repositories (broken links as of 2024).\n - Key variables: Country, Party, Populist (TRUE/FALSE), FarRight, ElectionYear, VoteShare, EU/National, party IDs, ideology tags, classification certainty, links to election results.\n - Use: Track party-level and cross-country populist trends over time; merge with COVID-19 policy datasets for comparative tests of policy → populism links.\n\n3.

        "description": "Summary of core findings from scientific and policy literature on COVID-19 mitigation policies and political populism:\n\n1. 'Medical populism' as a rhetorical strategy was widely adopted by some leaders (Brazil, Philippines, U.S.) to minimize risk, politicize science, dramatize governmental action, deepen distrust, and polarize public discourse (Lasco 2020; Lasco & Hedges 2021; Social Science & Medicine 2024).\n2. Populist rhetoric during health crises erodes trust in science, encourages resistance to expert guidance, and influences misinformation spread (Lasco 2020; Social Science & Medicine 2024).\n3. Survey results show that populist beliefs, especially anti-elitism/distrust of authority, are strongly associated with non-compliance with pandemic containment (Uluşahin et al., 2024).\n4. Policy analysis and news reporting show that populist leaders sometimes consolidated executive power, bypassed oversight, and exploited pandemic narratives for political gain (The Perilous Mix of Populism and Pandemics; Time, 2021).\n5. Support for right-wing populism correlates with resistance to vaccination and health measures, reflecting group dynamics and political trust (2022 study).\n6. Key mechanisms: politicization of science, simplification/spectacle, distrust/non-compliance, power consolidation, and polarized identity construction.\n\nReferences with links (where available):\n- Gideon Lasco, \"Medical populism and the COVID19 pandemic\" (2020)\n- Hedges & Lasco, \"Medical Populism and COVID19 Testing\" (2021)\n- 'Health emergencies, science contrarianism and populism', Social Science & Medicine (2024)\n- Uluşahin et al., 'Political psychology: populist beliefs & COVID19 compliance' (2024)\n- 'The Perilous Mix of Populism and Pandemics: Lessons from COVID' (policy report)\n- 'Right-Wing Populism, Social Identity Theory, and Resistance to COVID19 Measures' (2022)\n- 'Medical Populism' Has Defined the Philippines' Response to COVID-19 (news, Time, 2021)\n- 'Rage, waste and corruption: how Covid changed politics' (news)\n- Further reading: Gerbaudo, The Great Recoil (2021); Lasco & Persson (2022).\n\nKey mechanisms:\n- Politicization of Science\n- Simplification/Spectacle\n- Distrust & Non-compliance\n- Power Consolidation\n- Polarized Identity Construction",

Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)\n - Daily-coded data on COVID-19 mitigation policy indicators for ~180 countries (from Jan 2020). Key for quantifying policy response/severity.\n - File format: CSV (daily updates). Direct download (GitHub/official sources).\n - Key variables: StringencyIndex, GovernmentResponseIndex, ContainmentHealthIndex, EconomicSupportIndex, policy flags, country, date, ISO codes.\n - Use: Quantify severity/duration of policies by country, lag policy indices to test predictions for populist outcomes or unrest.\n\n2. The PopuList (Populist Parties in Europe)\n - Expert-coded dataset of European political parties by ideology (populist/far-right/left), with vote shares per election.\n - File format: TSV/CSV, direct download (OSF: https://osf.io/qdp8h/)\n - Key variables: Country, Party, Populist (TRUE/FALSE), FarRight, ElectionYear, VoteShare, EU/National, party IDs, ideology tags, links to election results.\n - Use: Track populist party trends post-COVID; merge with OxCGRT by country/year for correlations between lockdown stringency and vote shifts.\n\n6. VDem Dataset (Varieties of Democracy Project)\n - Massive cross-national dataset (500+ indicators: freedom, polarization, misinformation, autocratization).\n - File format: CSV (wide/panel), download after registration (https://www.v-dem.net/data/). Latest version 15 (March 2025) with coverage through 2024; all annual releases cover up to previous year (e.g., version 14 up to 2023).\n - Recency: Each version updated annually. Coverage is now full for pre-COVID (2018–2019), pandemic (2020–2021), and post-pandemic (2022–2024) periods (plus country/month data at v14).\n - Key variables: v2x_polyarchy, v2x_libdem, v2x_delibdem, v2x_partipdem (democracy indices), v2pepopul (populist discourse proxy), country_name, year, country_id.\n - Special project: 'Pandemic Backsliding,' quantifies democracy/authoritarian trends around 2020–21.\n - Use: Compare 2019 (pre-COVID), 2020–2021 (pandemic), and 2022–2024 (post-pandemic). Enables robust panel or time-series analysis of shifts linked to COVID policy, democracy, and populism.\n\nCurrent temporal limitation: As of VDem v15, only one full post-pandemic year (2024) is covered. Careful design is needed to avoid over-interpreting short-run populist trends.\n\nExample: Merge OxCGRT policy metrics (monthly/annual) with PopuList vote shares and V-Dem indicators (2018–2024), to analyze joint evolution of policy, democracy, and populism."

Version 15 (March 2025) is the latest release, providing annual data through 2024.\n- Latest data point: 2024 is currently the last covered year (v15 as of March 2025). v2pepopul is available for all major countries through 2024. Country-date (monthly) indicators available in v14 (up to 2024).\n- Key caution: Only one full year (2024) is post-pandemic for most countries in the panel; thus, there is limited observable time for longer-term populist effects of COVID policies. Major pandemic years: 2020–2021, with most mitigation winding down by autumn 2022; 2023 is largely transition; 2024 is true post-pandemic for many countries.\n- Utility: Still robust for comparing pre-pandemic (2018–2019), pandemic (2020–2021), immediate post-pandemic (2022–2024); but longer-term electoral/populism patterns may require return visits in future releases as electoral cycles play out and more temporal distance accumulates.\n- Special features: 'Pandemic Backsliding Project' (2020–21) for contextualized democracy measurements during COVID policy shifts.\n- Usage advice: Focus on short-run and immediate reactions, utilize higher-frequency (monthly) panel to identify early signals, supplement with protest data and electoral timing detail for maximal temporal resolution."

Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)\n - Daily-coded data on COVID-19 mitigation policy indicators for ~180 countries and regions (from Jan 2020). Key for quantifying policy response/severity, including subnational level (e.g., US states).\n - File format: CSV (daily updates). Direct download (GitHub/official sources).\n - Key variables: StringencyIndex, GovernmentResponseIndex, ContainmentHealthIndex, EconomicSupportIndex, policy flags, country, date, ISO codes.\n - Use: Quantify severity/duration of policies by country, lag policy indices to test predictions for populist outcomes or unrest.\n\n2. The PopuList (Populist Parties in Europe, v3.0)\n - Expert-coded dataset of European political parties by ideology (populist/far-right/left), with vote shares and parliamentary representation across elections. Captures party/classification detail, start/end periods, borderline/ruling status, country, and ideology markers.\n - File format: TSV/CSV. Direct download typically via OSF/official repositories (broken links as of 2024).\n - Key variables: Country, Party, Populist (TRUE/FALSE), FarRight, ElectionYear, VoteShare, EU/National, party IDs, ideology tags, classification certainty, links to election results.\n - Use: Track party-level and cross-country populist trends over time; merge with COVID-19 policy datasets for comparative tests of policy → populism links.\n\n3. VDem Dataset (Varieties of Democracy Project)\n - Large-scale, cross-national dataset of 500+ political regime indicators (democracy, polarization, misinformation, autocratization), including special COVID-19 variables.\n - File format: CSV (wide/panel). Download after registration. Latest version 15 covers years up to 2024.\n - Variables: v2x_polyarchy, v2x_libdem, v2x_delibdem, v2x_partipdem (democracy indices), v2pepopul (populist discourse/executive rhetoric), COVID-19 restriction variables, country_name, year, country_id, region, ISO codes, and others.\n - Use: Compare (pre-pandemic/pandemic/post-pandemic) years by democracy types, test policy–populism link, study detailed mechanisms indicated in the codebook for political regimes.\n\nCurrent temporal limitation: As of VDem v15 and PopuList v3.0, only a single full post-pandemic year (2024) is covered. Panel tests or event-driven analyses should note short-run limits for longer-term populist effects.\n\nExample: Merge OxCGRT policy metrics (monthly/annual) with PopuList vote shares/party traits and V-Dem indicators (2018–2024) to analyze the joint evolution of policies, democracy, and populism."

Track populist party rise, classification, and duration using period (start/end) columns. Visualize ideology shifts and timelines.\n2. Analyze effects of populist parties in government (filter for in_parliament = 1). Test if these parties behave differently (e.g., on pandemic policies) vs. those not in government.\n3. Disaggregate by ideology (far-right, far-left, centrist populists); compare vote shares, Euroscepticism, policy stances, and rhetoric.\n4. Merge with external datasets (OxCGRT, V-Dem, trust/attitude surveys, macro indicators) by country/party/year/ID for joint analysis of policy-populism links, temporal patterns, and contextual drivers.\n5. Examples of analytic and visual tasks:\n   • Timeline/stacked area of populist waves per country\n   • Map showing populist presence\n   • Scatter/diagrams: populism vs COVID response, or trust/satisfaction\n6. Use IDs (parlgov_id, partyfacts_id) for robust merging/validation against other political/party/factual sources.\n7. Research extensions: Test relationships like “Did government populists resist lockdowns?” or “Does populist ideology predict vaccine attitudes?”\n8. Highlight classification changes/ideology transitions for nuanced party histories.\n\nSuitable for longitudinal, cross-national, and mechanism-focused political science analysis.",

Around 1940, a sharp drop in democracy indices corresponds with the abolition of democracy: King Carol II's establishment of a royal dictatorship, followed by authoritarian and fascist regimes during WWII (e.g., General Antonescu, Iron Guard).\n2. Between ~1989–2000, a steep rise in democracy indices reflects the Romanian Revolution (fall of Ceaușescu/communism in 1989), multi-party elections (1990), constitutional reform (1991), consolidation of democratic institutions, and eventual EU alignment and accession (2007).\n\nThese shifts in the V-Dem indicators mirror real historical regime change events: from (pre-)WWII democracy to dictatorship/fascism, to communist authoritarianism, and finally to post-communist democratization.",
