Medical populism (Lasco 2020): Leaders (Brazil, Philippines, US) used 'medical populism'—minimizing risk, politicizing science, dramatizing crisis, and framing experts as elites—which led to deeper distrust in science and polarized discourse.\n2. Medical Populism and COVID19 Testing (Hedges & Lasco 2021): Populist leaders simplified messaging, used spectacle, 'us-vs-them' narratives, and exclusive-knowledge claims, affecting public perceptions and policy compliance.\n3. Science contrarianism & populism (2024): Populist rhetoric amidst health crises eroded trust in science/public health, promoting misinformation and less compliance.\n4. Populist beliefs & compliance (Uluşahin et al. 2024): Survey evidence—populist beliefs/distrust of authority strongly correlated with poor compliance, reinforcing anti-elitism.\n5. Perilous Mix report: Populist governments neglected expert advice, overstated achievements, and consolidated power, undermining democratic accountability.\n6. RightWing Populism & COVID19 Measures (2022): Correlation between right-wing populism support and resistance to vaccination/mitigation, linked to political trust/identity.\n7. National case studies (e.g., Time 2021): Populist leaders leveraged crisis rhetoric for crackdowns, blame-shifting, polarizing society, and undermining institutions.\n\nKey mechanisms identified:\n- Politicization of science/elite framing\n- Simplification/spectacle\n- Distrust and non-compliance\n- Power consolidation/oversight bypass\n- Policies as identity/polarization markers\n\nReferences provided for further reading and prominent news/newsletter articles.",

Slight Dip Post-Election (+1 to +3): Noticeable decline, especially for deliberative and egalitarian democracy; possible explanations: disillusionment/backlash, partisan governance, resolved uncertainty failing to yield reform.\n\nAdditional interpretations/caveats:\n- Elections as 'democracy showcase' but the boost is short-lived; lack of structural follow-through, especially if authoritarian-leaning winners.\n- Data lag and visibility bias: some effects only register later; V-Dem may reflect only well-documented events, not immediate ones.\n\nHypothesis supported by the graph: Elections often create temporary democratic health boosts, but scores can stagnate or decline without institutional follow-through.",
