Here are the first two things that interest me (but more of those sort of questions might pop up along the way): 1. How did Covid (the disease itself) and Covid mitigation policies affect men vs. women? 2. How did Covid mitigation policies (per country?) translate into social and economic effect during but especially after the pandemic.

This style deepened public distrust in science and polarized public discourse.\n\n2. \"Medical Populism and COVID19 Testing\" (Hedges & Lasco, 2021)\n\nA case study of how populist leaders framed COVID testing:\n\nSimplification of complex medical information\n\nSpectacle in presenting testing policies\n\nUs-versus-them dividing narratives\n\nClaims to exclusive knowledge\nThis shaped public perception and acceptance of testing campaigns.\n\n3. Health emergencies, science contrarianism and populism (2024, Social Science & Medicine)\n\nFinds that populist rhetoric during health crises erodes trust in science and public health policies, fueling the spread of misinformation and resistance to mitigation measures.\n\n4. Political psychology paper: populist beliefs & COVID19 compliance (Uluşahin et al., 2024)\n\nSurvey data from St Andrews showing that populist beliefs—particularly distrust of authority—strongly correlate with lower compliance with containment measures, reinforcing anti-elitist attitudes.\n\n5. \"The Perilous Mix of Populism and Pandemics: Lessons from COVID\"\n\nA policy analysis report concluding that populist governments neglected expert guidance, overstated achievements, and exploited the crisis to consolidate power and undermine democratic accountability.\n\n6. \"RightWing Populism, Social Identity Theory, and Resistance to COVID19 Measures\" (2022)\n\nDiscusses a solid correlation between support for right-wing populism and resistance to vaccination and other mitigation policies, based on social identity and political trust dynamics.\n\n7. Case studies: Philippines, Brazil, and the U.S. (Time, 2021)\n\nReports highlight how populist leaders (Duterte, Bolsonaro, Trump) used lockdowns and pandemic rhetoric to justify authoritarian crackdowns, shift blame, and inflame divisions—all while undermining science and institutions.\n\n🔑 Key Mechanisms Identified\n\nPoliticization of Science: expert advice is framed as elite control.\n\nSimplification/Spectacle: crisis portrayed in binary, populist terms.\n\nDistrust & Non-compliance: populist cues → less public health buy-in.\n\nPower Consolidation: pandemic measures used to bypass oversight.\n\nPolarized Identity Construction: policies become markers of political identity.\n\n📚 Further Reading\n\nGerbaudo, The Great Recoil (2021) – explores how the pandemic accelerated a shift toward state-led populist intervention.\n\nLasco & Persson (2022) – delve into how populist discourse framed public health as a moral battle.\n\nLet me know if you'd like summaries of specific case studies, academic papers, or help locating full-text versions!\n\nKey recent news on COVIDpopulism erosion of trust\n\n'Medical Populism' Has Defined the Philippines' Response to COVID-19.

For Romania, we can analyze:\n\nv2elmulpar – Multiparty elections: Are multiple parties allowed to contest?\n\nv2elfrfair – Free and fair elections: Was the electoral process competitive and impartial?\n\nv2elvotbuy – Vote buying: Is there evidence of clientelism or bribery?\n\nv2elirreg – Election irregularities: Were there administrative or procedural flaws?\n\nv2x_suffr – Suffrage: Is the right to vote broadly inclusive?\n\nSome of these indicators may have moderate scores even under communism — for instance, suffrage was universal and regular elections were held (though not competitive).\n\n🧭 Hypothesis\n\nIn the interwar period, Romania had some pluralism, but also:\n\nKing Carol II’s authoritarian tendencies by late 1930s\n\nElectoral violence and manipulation\n\nIn the communist period, elections were held but:\n\nNo genuine competition\n\nOnly the Communist Party participated\n\nState-controlled media and repression\n\nSo despite elections happening regularly, key elements like genuine competition and freedom of choice were absent — and that’s what we'd expect to see reflected in lower v2elmulpar or v2elfrfair values.\n\n➡️ Next step?\n\nWould you like me to extract and plot these mid-level variables to visually compare:\n\nInterwar (1919–1939)\n\nCommunist (1947–1989)\n\nDemocratic (post-1990) periods?\n\nThis would clearly show where the weaknesses lay."

    "content": "Excellent point — and you're asking a very nuanced and critical question:\n\n“How much are the V-Dem scores shaped by changes in reality vs. changes in visibility, media, or measurement?”\n\nThis touches on recency bias, information asymmetry, and methodological shifts. Let’s unpack this:\n\n🧠 1. Recency Effects Are Very Real\n\nV-Dem relies heavily on:\n\nExpert coders (often local academics)\n\nAvailable sources, including media, reports, and civil society documentation\n\nAs a result:\n\nPost-2010 events are better documented, more transparent, and more visible internationally.\n\nEarlier decades (especially 1990s) had less consistent coverage, fewer NGOs, weaker press, and more chaotic data environments.\n\n📚 2. Historical Events Like the Mineriads (1990s)\n\nYou're absolutely right:\n\n1990 & 1991 Mineriads: State-supported miners attacked peaceful protesters and opposition groups in Bucharest.\n\nThese were massive blows to democratic norms, but at the time:\n\nThere were fewer watchdogs or international observers in place.\n\nRomania was not yet integrated into EU or NATO reporting networks.\n\nV-Dem’s expert pool may not have had the same granular access to interpret those events.\n\nSo while functionally severe, they may not register as sharply in the data as more recent, better-documented events.\n\n🧪 3. Methodology Shifts Over Time\n\nWhile V-Dem tries to ensure cross-temporal consistency, it:\n\nAdds more indicators over time\n\nChanges coders as people rotate out\n\nMay shift the framing of questions slightly\n\nThese introduce measurement noise, especially around the early years of data collection (2000s and earlier).\n\n🧭 Bottom Line\n\nThe rise-and-fall pattern in the 2019–2021 period may partly reflect real institutional flux,\nbut also be amplified by:\n\nBetter monitoring\n\nMore responsive coders\n\nIncreased data visibility\n\nMeanwhile, events from the 1990s may be understated due to poorer data ecosystems and limited contextual awareness at the time.\n\n✅ What You Could Do\n\nIf you're building a historical analysis:\n\nAnnotate major political shocks and compare their V-Dem response\n\nConsider applying a \"visibility adjustment lens\" (e.g., rating how well-covered each event was)\n\nLook at standard deviation or coder disagreement (V-Dem includes uncertainty bounds) for the early years\n\nWould you like to see how coder confidence or disagreement changed over time for Romania? That could be a proxy for data reliability."

    "content": "Great question — and this graph actually reveals subtle but meaningful patterns worth unpacking. Here's my take:\n\n🔎 Key Observations from the Graph\n\n1. Flat or Slight Rise Before the Election (−3 to 0)\n\nMost indices, especially liberal and electoral democracy, show a modest increase leading up to the election.\n\nThis may reflect:\n\nPre-election reforms or efforts to signal democratic commitment (e.g., to the EU or voters).\n\nIncreased civic engagement and scrutiny around election time.\n\n2. Peak or Plateau Around Election Year (0)\n\nFor many indicators, year 0 (election) marks a local maximum.\n\nCould be due to:\n\nDemocratic practices functioning \"at their best\" during elections (at least procedurally).\n\nHigher transparency or participation temporarily boosting scores.\n\n3. Slight Dip Post-Election (+1 to +3)\n\nThere's a noticeable drop in some indices after elections, particularly:\n\nDeliberative democracy and egalitarian democracy\n\nThis could reflect:\n\nDisillusionment or backlash after the election.\n\nConsolidation of power or partisan governance eroding quality.\n\nThe election may have resolved uncertainty but not delivered reform.\n\n🧠 Interpretation & Caveats\n\n📌 Elections as a “Democracy Showcase” — but short-lived\n\nElections can temporarily inflate democratic indicators (more debate, scrutiny, engagement).\n\nBut they don't guarantee institutional follow-through, especially if authoritarian-leaning actors win.\n\n⚠️ Beware of Lag and Visibility Bias\n\nSome effects (positive or negative) may only appear 1–2 years later.\n\nV-Dem data may reflect events once they're well-documented, not immediately.\n\n📈 Potential Use\n\nThis graph supports a more nuanced hypothesis:\n\n“Elections often generate temporary boosts in democratic health — but without structural follow-through, scores can stagnate or decline.”\n\nYou could build on this with:\n\nCountry-level panels to spot outliers\n\nCompare 2022 vs. 2023 elections separately\n\nIdentify whether score changes correlate with who won (populist, reformist, etc.)\n\nWould you like to explore any of these angles next?\n\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form"
