    "summary": "The PopuList dataset (version 3.0) identifies and catalogs populist, far-right, and far-left political parties across Europe, covering data from 1989-2022. Key columns denote country, party names, electoral dates, ideological tags, and vote shares, which are useful for exploring trends and shifts in political landscapes related to populism. Example entries, such as the Italian League or French National Rally, provide context for analyzing these entities' electoral performance within broader socio-political frameworks, especially when linked to measures like OxCGRT data."
