Hedges & Lasco (2021): Populist leaders simplified/disputed COVID testing; spectacle and divisive narratives; reduced testing campaign buy-in.\n3. Social Science & Medicine (2024): Populist rhetoric during health crises erodes trust in science and public health, fuels misinformation/resistance.\n4. Uluşahin et al. (2024): Populist beliefs correlate with non-compliance with containment measures (via anti-elitist distrust).\n5. Policy report ('Perilous Mix...'): Populist governments neglected expertise, overstated success, consolidated power, reduced accountability.\n6. Right-wing populism & resistance (2022): RWP correlates with refusal re: vaccination, mitigation, based on social identity and trust.\n7. Case study reports (Philippines, Brazil, US): Populist leadership used pandemic to legitimize crackdowns, shift blame, polarize society.\n\nKey Mechanisms Identified:\n- Politicization of science (expert advice framed as elitism/control)\n- Simplification/spectacle (crisis reframed in populist binaries)\n- Distrust/non-compliance\n- Crisis as justification for democratic backsliding\n- Policies as political identity markers\n\nFurther reading suggested (Gerbaudo 2021, Lasco & Persson 2022) and links to media coverage of populist pandemic responses.",
