Correlate temporal trends in trust/perception metrics (e.g., fairness, doing a good job) with contemporaneous stop-to-population ratios for Black, White, Asian groups, especially to test if higher disproportionality aligns with lower overall trust.\n2. Overlay/main event analysis: Place vertical markers of policy events, major leadership transitions, misconduct scandals in the trust time series to observe coincident dips or trend inflections (examples: Dec 2022 Guardian article, Met leadership change, SVRO rollout).\n3. Borough-level trust vs. stop/search disparity: (if data allows) Compare borough-level trust survey scores to local stop rates/disparities; look for areas with the steepest trust decline or highest disproportionality.\n4. (If demographic splits available) Cross-tab by ethnicity, age, and gender: Compare trust trends (e.g. Black vs. White, younger vs older) to see which groups are losing trust most rapidly.\n5. Compare trust by contact type: Where survey microdata are available, contrast perception among respondents with involuntary (stops) vs. voluntary contact with police (victims, callers), to test procedural justice theory.\n6. Statistical/lags: Quantify relationship (e.g. lagged regression, Granger causality, interrupted time series) between trust measures and stop/search disparity; test directionality and magnitude of effects.",
