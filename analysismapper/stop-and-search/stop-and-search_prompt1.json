Variables include trust in police, fairness, contact history, willingness to cooperate, and more. Microdata includes demographic fields (age, gender, ethnicity), experience-based factors (victimisation, stopped by police, contact type). Data is accessed via UK Data Service as anonymised microdata (SPSS, Stata, CSV). Registration and licensing are required. The CSEW supports subgroup disaggregation for analyses such as trust by ethnicity, age, gender, and experience with police.
