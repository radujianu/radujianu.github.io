Stark racial disproportionality in stop and search rates:\n   - Black individuals are ~3.5 times more likely to be stopped and searched than White individuals (71/1000 vs 18/1000); persists after adjusting for population.\n   - Lammy Review (2017): Black individuals ~9x more likely to be stopped for possession of drugs, though actual drug use is lower.\n2. Low find/arrest rates, especially for minorities:\n   - Black Londoners find-rate 26.7% vs 30.5% for Whites; StopWatch reports show high stop rate but low success for Black people.\n3. Spatial concentration:\n   - Stop and search highly concentrated in diverse/high-deprivation areas; 80% of Black stops in just 8 London force areas.\n4. Effectiveness:\n   - Operations (e.g. \"Blunt 2\") have little sustained crime reduction impact; community-based/crime prevention favored.\n5. Youth and trust impact:\n   - Black children 15% more likely to be criminalised; reports highlight \"adultification\" (perceiving Black youth as older/more culpable).\n\nKey takeaways to benchmark analysis:\n- Use disparities as a baseline for spatial/demographic trends.\n- Test link between stop-and-search and crime reduction.\n- Overlay public perception and youth outcomes as possible.",

Overlay Key Events or Policies\n   - Annotate trust timeline with events: leadership changes, major misconduct, policy reforms, media scrutiny (e.g., Dec 2022 Guardian article).\n   - Purpose: See if dips in trust align with external shocks.\n\n3. Borough-Level Analysis\n   - Compare trust scores vs. stop-and-search activity by borough.\n   - Purpose: Test for spatial variation (e.g., areas with high policing see faster trust erosion).\n\n4. Cross-Demographic Comparisons (if available)\n   - Contrast confidence among demographic subgroups (e.g., White vs Black, young vs old, male vs female) over time.\n   - Data required: PAS with splits, or CSEW microdata.\n\n5.
